This is my class XII CBSE project.
This project aims at making a feasible dictionary in a simple GUI environment.It is designed to compile with Turbo C++.
So for those who are running windows newer than windows xp can run Turbo c++ using [DOSBox] (http://www.dosbox.com/) (a free Dos Emulator).
The definations of the words file wasn't added to the repository as it is larger than 100 mb. You could request it on my email.

For all other details refer to the report folder containig all the source code and screenshots in portable document format (pdf).
Along with a html file for index.  

You can find the documentation hosted at https://diveshuttam.github.io/AED/
